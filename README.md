OHLC Data Pipeline

This repository contains a Python script for ingesting, cleaning, transforming, validating, and storing Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) data from various sources and formats. The script is designed to handle data feeds for multiple stocks and perform necessary data processing tasks to ensure data integrity and standardization.
Features

    Data Ingestion: Ingest OHLC data feeds from various sources and formats.
    Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, correct outliers, and address inconsistencies in timestamps or date formats.
    Data Transformation: Calculate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index), apply feature engineering techniques, and resample the data based on desired frequencies.
    Data Validation: Implement unit tests to ensure the pipeline's functionality and data integrity, and monitor for errors and data quality issues.
    Data Storage: Utilize a simple database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store the processed data, partition it for efficient querying, and optimize the data format for fast retrieval and analysis.

  
  Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional features to add to the OHLC data pipeline, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
